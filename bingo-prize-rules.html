                        <p>Administration and winner selection and verification will be conducted by PenguinPointscom LLC whose decisions are final and legally binding. No participant or winner shall have the right to contest any decision by Sponsor or the independent judging organization concerning any aspect of the Promotion or the interpretation of the Official Rules or the determination as to the qualification of entries. By participating in the Promotion, you agree to be bound by these Official Rules. Proof of entry is not proof of entry receipt. Sponsor is not responsible for those who cannot access the Internet or cannot click-through for any period of time regardless of technical, hardware, software, telephone, Internet, virus contamination or network problems, or for delay, failure or malfunction for any reason including, but not limited to, lost or unavailable network connections, failed, incomplete or garbled computer or telephone transmissions, typographical or system errors, human errors, including, but not limited to, errors by Sponsor's systems/representatives who enter incorrect information into any of Sponsor's computer systems or by force majeure. Sponsor is not responsible for the random loss of entries or failure to attribute entries which was a result of temporary errors in the Sponsor's systems, application and/or database. Sponsor is not responsible for failure of email communication reaching the email in-box of the participant. Sponsor reserves the right to cancel/terminate, modify or suspend the Promotion in all three creative presentations if in Sponsor's sole determination it believes that the integrity of the Promotion has been, or could be, compromised or that the Promotion is not capable of running as planned or fairly, including infection by computer virus, bugs, tampering, unauthorized intervention, fraud, technical failures, or force majeure or any other causes beyond Sponsor's control. The next weekly winner will be drawn from among all eligible entries received up to the time of the cancellation/termination. No further weekly winners will be drawn and the Prize will not be awarded. Sponsor reserves the right to disqualify any entry from the Promotion if in Sponsor's sole judgment it suspects that entrant has not complied with these Official Rules. Without limitation, all of an entrant's entries will be disqualified, at the sole discretion of Sponsor, if Sponsor suspects than an entrant attempts (i) to enter the Promotion through any means other than as described in these Official Rules; (ii) provides information that is inaccurate or fraudulent; or (iii) attempts to disrupt the Promotion or circumvent the terms and conditions of these Official Rules. Sponsor assumes no liability for damage caused to entrant's or any other person's/entity's computer hardware, software or communications network, regardless of cause. Prize winner will be required to execute and return an Affidavit of Eligibility, Liability and Publicity Release within three (3) days of date on email notification or it will be concluded definitively that the prize has been declined and, without further notice, an alternative winner may be selected in random drawings. If the publicity portion of the affidavit is legally prohibited in the jurisdiction of the winner, that aspect will be eliminated. </p>

The right to receive a prize is non-assignable and non-transferable and no prize substitution or exchange or cash equivalent will be allowed except by Sponsor who reserves the right to substitute a prize (or portion of prize) of equal or greater value in case of unavailability of a prize or force majeure. A prize or prize notification that is returned as undeliverable will disqualify the potential winner and an alternative potential winner shall be selected in random drawings shortly thereafter.</p>

						<p>Acceptance of the prize grants to Sponsor and its designees the right to publicize winner's name, address (city and state of residence), photograph, voice and/or likeness and prize information in any media now known or hereafter devised, throughout the world, in perpetuity, without limitation and without additional compensation or consideration, notification or permission, unless prohibited by law.

Some jurisdictions do not allow the limitation or exclusion of liability for incidental or consequential damages, so the above may not apply to you. All issues and questions concerning the construction, validity, interpretation and enforceability of these Official Rules, or the rights and obligations of the entrant and Sponsor in connection with the Promotion, shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of Massachusetts, without giving effect to any choice of law or conflict of law rules (whether of the State of Massachusetts or any other jurisdiction), which would cause the application of the laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of Massachusetts.</p>
